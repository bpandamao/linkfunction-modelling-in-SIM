# The B-spline prior and Bernstein polynomial prior 

Both priors are used in the approximation of the link function in the Single-index model. Based on the Bayesian nonparametric framework and Bayesian median regression, the asymmetric Laplace distribution (ALD) is chosen as the error distribution, and the latent binary indicator variables are applied to help select the significant predictors. The posterior samples are generated by a Metropolis-Hastings-within-Gibbs algorithm.
