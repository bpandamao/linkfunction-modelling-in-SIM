# The B-spline prior and Bernstein polynomial prior 

Both priors are used in the approximation of the link function in the Single-index model. Based on the Bayesian nonparametric framework and Bayesian median regression, the asymmetric Laplace distribution (ALD) is chosen as the error distribution, and the latent binary indicator variables are applied to help select the significant predictors. The posterior samples are generated by a Metropolis-Hastings-within-Gibbs algorithm.

[bspline_prior.r](./bspline_prior.r) is the implementation of the proposed B-spline prior, while [bernstein_polynomial_prior.r](./bernstein_polynomial_prior.r) is the previous approach to do the estimation of the link function.

To reduce the total running time, parLapply in parallel package is used to run each replication simultaneously. The codes in numerical studies are available in [numerical_simulation.r](./numerical_simulation.r).
